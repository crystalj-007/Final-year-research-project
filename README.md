Summary:
The impact of residential solar PV system integration on power quality in a distribution network is investigated in this report. When small-scale residential solar PV systems are integrated into a distribution grid, the capacity of the plant and its fluctuating generation are likely to impact the power quality of the network in terms of voltage and frequency. In this project, DIgSILENT PowerFactory was used to design distribution networks with the integration of solar PV plants. The project considered different loadings on the distribution feeders and high, medium, and low levels of penetration of solar PV systems in that area. To study the power quality of the system, voltage and frequency profiles for the distribution networks were simulated and analysed against a base case, which did not include the integration of PV plants. The voltage and frequency deviations were calculated and the magnitudes of the simulated voltages and frequencies complied with standard South African grid codes for renewable energy integration. It was discovered that power quality is impacted by various factors in a distribution network such as distribution voltage levels, penetration levels, and load variation.
